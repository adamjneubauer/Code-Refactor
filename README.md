# Code-Refactor

The scope of this project was to modernize the code of the Horiseon homepage to meet accessibility standards. Both HTML and CSS code was changed, with some of the specific changes commented in the HTML document for easy tracking.

The majority of the div tags were replaced with semantic tags, and all the images had alt attributes added to them. The original HTML document contained many many class tags that were unnecessary and only served to cause confusion and potentially cause problems down the line. In addition, one of the links in the header section was fixed to link to the intended section on the page.
  
The CSS page contained many redundant code, so most of this was removed or combined into one element to clean up the document. "Float" class attributes removed and added to the image ID's.

The final product is a functional webpage with source code that contains semantic elements, has elements in a logical order, contains alt attributes for all images, has a concise title, and has heading elements that fall in sequential order.
